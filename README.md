This app. is being developed on top of https://github.com/ravisiyer/verysimplegita which is a very simple but functional, open-source freeware, Bhagavad Gita web app.

In this app. I plan to add regular web UI features. I will be using Tailwind CSS. I also will use TypeScript. But it no longer will be a very simple gita app.

The app. uses Next.js and Apollo Client to retrieve Bhagavad Gita chapters and verses data from a GraphQL endpoint: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphql (Explorer: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphiql), and displays it on browser. It is shared under free-software MIT license.

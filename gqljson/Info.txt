I am using few hard-coded query results for simplicity of Settings client component code.
Executing GraphQL queries on server is quite straightforward coding-wise but on client side
the code seems to be more involved (I have not done that so far.) So for data that may
change very infrequently, I have gone for hard-coded query results option.
This directory contains all the small console based programs that use data queries to
get the data and then save it as json files in jsondata directory.
This json data is used by few .ts files in main app that define constants with the json
data and these constants are imported by parts of the app and used.

Later I will consider using client side Apollo client code to pick up data from GraphQL source directly.

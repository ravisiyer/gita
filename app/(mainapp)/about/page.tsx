        I have changed the User Interface (UI) of this app to a regular web app
        UI. But, from a source code point of view, it no longer is a very simple
        Gita app. Students and other learners may want to first go through the
        source code of Very Simple Gita app before going through this app&apos;s
        source code.

        This Gita web app uses Next.js and Apollo Client to retrieve Bhagavad
        Gita chapters and verses data from a GraphQL endpoint, and displays it
        on browser. It also uses Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.
